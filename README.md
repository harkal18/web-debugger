=> Using this uitlity one can remote debug any number of clients to your server over LAN

=> i use it to debug my websites in safari. first i connect my ubuntu desktop to android phone's hotspot and then i also connect my iphone to my android's hotspot. after then i enable port forwaring on my android and send all requests coming to wlan0 interface to the ip of my computer. which finally enables me debug safari without a mac.

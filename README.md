# Story

> I have a ubuntu desktop,  an iphone and an ipad but not a mac
> And i have so many websites running which run well on chrome
> but not in safari[webkit] and there is no easy way to debug safari
> using non-mac desktop. So i came up with the idea of writing this utility
> which might also help other developers who have the same story
> _
> For debugging safari on ipone and ipad i use my android hotspot as a bridge
> i connect my iphone and ipad to android hotspot and then i port forward
> all incoming requests from wlan0 interface to my desktop IP 
> and rest is handled by this utility
